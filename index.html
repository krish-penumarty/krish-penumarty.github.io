              My name is Krish Penumarty and I'm currently working at American Express as a Software Engineer in the Cloud Platform Engineering team. I started my career with American Express under the Engineering Development Program. During the program I had the opportunity to learn various skill sets in technology and leadership.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have taken various roles over the past 18 months on different projects from Devops Engineer, UI Developer and now Full Stack Engineer. My passion is to keep learning and continuously improve myself in every aspect of my life. While I am currently working, I am also in the process of completing the Full Stack Engineer course through Udacity to help enable me to achieve the highest results at work. If I am not working or learning you can find me constantly adventuring and traveling the world.
